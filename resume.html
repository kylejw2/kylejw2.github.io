            <li>Encouraged all students, roughly 80 per semester, to check assignments with me before due dates, granting them every opportunity to get full points before the assignment was turned in. This led to more assignments being turned in on time, and increased the assignment grades to perfect scores of those who were willing to work extra than necessary.</li>

            <li>Learned to discuss my opinions and hear others in a manner that encouraged growth as a whole.</li>
            <li>Jokingly and anonymously submitted a poem which led to much laughter and an argument among the staff as to what poetry truly is.</li>
